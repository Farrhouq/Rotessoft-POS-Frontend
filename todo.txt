    so, for products, we're kinda sorted.
    it's updated in the frontend. I'll just use the indexeddb to queue the request.
    then I'll have another code for sending those requests, or queuing them.
    Now, for the sales...
*I'll do something similar.
*offline system for making things faster
*add shop
*requestQueue.js: line 124
*admin empty sales the graph doesn't show
*admin first time login the side bar shows instead of hiding
*admin should be able to sell. (as a preference to some admins)
*receipt font size and paper length
*loading of the addproduct modal when submitting
*time maa di nyela wrong (the problem was from their timezone)
*when they press enter, it should auto go to the next input, then finally the print button
*handle the onafter print (the mechanism changed, y'know)
*there's also something with how seamless it is to add another product
*field for showing the balance for the customer
*capitalize the customer name when printing (small details, but I have an urge to make quality)
*(finally) recording the time of the sale (for offline sales when pushing back)
*sale detail
*only keep request in queue if it's a network error, else just pop it out.
*trying to add sales without entering products first doesn't work
*main dashboard spinner not spinning when loading
*focus on add product name input when the modal is first opened
*admin cache the stores and dashboard info (and for main dash)
*open the side nav when user enters first so they can see the tab labels (on large screens)
*searchable products
*sale made by: to sale object (backend)
*start caching the sale details
*reversing sales
*change logo on sidenav to Rotessoft logo
*fetching of sales from different dates (from backend) (and cache them too)
*linking the customer details to the sale. (in the backend as well)
*loader when submitting employee information (admin)
*loader when submitting when editing product
*when they press enter, it should navigate around (for the add sale page) (before the receipt)

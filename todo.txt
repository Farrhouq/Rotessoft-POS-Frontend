* back to dashboardofdashboads button on adminDashboard
* edit product
* delete product (might be in the same place as edit)
* refresh products button
* append 0's at on the graph for a good look.
** alert for when products are finishing (color coded quantity)

    so, for products, we're kinda sorted.
    it's updated in the frontend. I'll just use the indexeddb to queue the request.
    then I'll have another code for sending those requests, or queuing them.
    Now, for the sales...
*I'll do something similar.
*offline system for making things faster
*add shop
*requestQueue.js: line 124
*admin empty sales the graph doesn't show
*admin first time login the side bar shows instead of hiding
*admin should be able to sell. (as a preference to some admins)
*receipt font size and paper length
*loading of the addproduct modal when submitting
*time maa di nyela wrong (the problem was from their timezone)
*when they press enter, it should auto go to the next input, then finally the print button
*handle the onafter print (the mechanism changed, y'know)
*there's also something with how seamless it is to add another product
*field for showing the balance for the customer
*capitalize the customer name when printing (small details, but I have an urge to make quality)
*(finally) recording the time of the sale (for offline sales when pushing back)
*sale detail
*only keep request in queue if it's a network error, else just pop it out.
*trying to add sales without entering products first doesn't work
*main dashboard spinner not spinning when loading
*focus on add product name input when the modal is first opened
*admin cache the stores and dashboard info (and for main dash)

urgent!!
--
start caching the sale details
open the side nav when user enters first so they can see the tab labels (on large screens)


print sale when viewing sale details (after saving)
linking the customer details and amount given to the sale. (in the backend as well)
sale id, shortening it (linking it to the actual sale id from the backend)
reversing sales
when they press enter, it should navigate around (for the add sale page) (before the receipt)
loader when submitting employee information (admin)
loader when submitting when editing product
fetching of sales from different dates (from backend) (and cache them too)

searchable products
add TOTAL column to admin products view

sale made by: to sale object (backend)
shop customizable receipts (a bit of a stretch)
edit info on receipts (add shop description and address to shop)

key features should highlight some words.

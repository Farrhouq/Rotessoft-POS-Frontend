so, for products, we're kinda sorted.
it's updated in the frontend. I'll just use the indexeddb to queue the request.

*I'll do something similar.
*offline system for making things faster
*add shop
*requestQueue.js: line 124
*admin empty sales the graph doesn't show
*admin first time login the side bar shows instead of hiding
*admin should be able to sell. (as a preference to some admins)
*receipt font size and paper length
*loading of the addproduct modal when submitting
*time maa di nyela wrong (the problem was from their timezone)
*when they press enter, it should auto go to the next input, then finally the print button
*handle the onafter print (the mechanism changed, y'know)
*there's also something with how seamless it is to add another product
*field for showing the balance for the customer

*(finally) recording the time of the sale (for offline sales when pushing back)
